    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Passerines\n",
    "This [Globam Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQQeXGvYc4) is a 2 minute animation which shows the ambition of the European Weather Radar network. In this course we will explore the use of Weather Radars to identify mass migration of small passerine birds. \n",
    "Small passerine birds migrate en masse during Spring and Fall. These migration events can be significant enough to observe on Meteorological Radars. Passerine birds do not migrate continuously throughout the season but instead seemingly wait for favorable weather conditions. These weather conditions have been identified to a certain extend and as such certain moments can be defined on which peak migration would likely occur. \n",
    "### Meteorological Radar\n",
    "Meteorological radars monitor the sky 24/7 and are able to detect small objects, such as birds.  A Meteorological radar emits a beam and attempts to detect the reflection of the beam. Most objects, including birds, tend to reflect at least part of the energy of the radar beam. This makes Meteorological radars ideal to use in observing peak migration events. However, as a Meteorological radar is not purposefully built to detect small passerines, some effort has to be made in order to produce meaningful data. Furthermore, as ideal as it sounds that a device measures 24/7 you will end up with more information than you generally can handle, some pruning is required. \n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "As we have a decent understanding of favorable weather conditions we can start to narrow down our search towards the few times in the year that we have favorable conditions for passerines. Furthermore, we can apply certain transformations to the data which will allow us to filter, summarize and visualize the data which will help us focus on the actual migration rather than weather phenomena. \n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "For this introduction, you will be introduced to some of the core principles of Radar Aeroecology, specifically Meteorological Radar data analysis. You will download Meteorological Radar Data from The Netherlands from multiple radars, process, visualize and interpret. You do not have to be proficient in either Python or R to complete these exercises. This introduction will be done in the Radar Aeroecology Virtual Research Environment (RAVRE) which you will be introduced to through exercises. After the introduction you will be guided to choose a moments in time to determine if you can witness a peak migration event. Furthermore, you will be introduced to more advanced visualization techniques in R by using the `bioRad` ([paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.04028), [library documentation](https://adriaandokter.com/bioRad/articles/bioRad.html)) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAVL is a Virtual Lab built on NaaVRE. That means that RAVL follows the guidelines of NaaVRE which means there is a specific way of doing things. Throughout these exercises you will be asked to use the experiment manager to connect one block to another, eventually forming a complete workflow. \n",
    "Most exercises have a `Note:` section. This section generally explains a bit more about the how and what about the block. This information is not necessary to go through the introduction but might be interesting to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercise 1. Configuration\n",
    "First, we need to set certain parameters and configurations. We will be using a course specific API ([What is API?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api)) key from the Dutch meteorological institute, KNMI (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut). With this key, we can authenticate ourselves within the data repository of [The KNMI Data Platform](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/). From this platform, we will be retrieving Polar Volume Data which contains a host of parameters which can be used to detect biological echoes. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Important to know`: The API key used during this course is only valid for the duration of the course. KNMI has been kind and provided us with our own custom workshop API-key. They have done this to help us 'guarantee' to have access to the data without having to register or share the key with other anonymous users. As this is courtesy, please keep in mind to keep your queries short. Practically this means: Choose a day to retrieve data for, not a year. If you decide you want to see an effect over a large temporal time span, sample interval can be reduced. For example: every 15th day of the month, every X'th hour of the day. You do not have enough time during this course to download, convert and analyze large amounts of data nor will the API-key allow all participants to download a large dataset. Rest assured, throughout the exercises you will be guided on how to query and stay within the `fair-use policy` and still get interesting results.  \n",

    "`Note:` There are three types of parameters recognized by NaaVRE Code analyzer: `param` and `conf`. The keyword `param` signifies that the user needs to supply this information when a workflow is executed. This could be a name of a Radar, a date, your password, etc. The keyword `conf` signifies that it holds information publicly shared. You would not enter your password here as it would be public to the world. You would use `conf` to indicate where your storage is located, what your maximum number of files needs to be, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the left hand side, you can see the `component containeriser`. This allows us to store the code we just entered in the notebook as a code-block. We will eventually make a few more of these code-blocks and use them to make a workflow out of them. Click the `component containeriser` and containerise the code. Now your code cell is configured and you can go ahead and press `Create`. It will take a few minutes before it shows up in our cell catalogue. Instead of waiting, we are going to continue adding some more blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we continue creating the next block, lets add an extra cell below and add some information such that we can use it to test our upcoming code blocks. You should have received an API key from one of the instructors. Create a new jupyter cell below the current one and and enter the information displayed below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DO NOT CONTAINERISE THIS CELL. DUMMY CELL FOR CONFIGURATION OF JUPYTER CODE ONLY.\n",

    "param_end_date = \"2020-01-01T01:00+00:00\" # %Y%m%dT%H:%M+TZ; 2020-01-01T01:00+00:00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you could be wondering: But isn't `param` used to request input on execution of the workflow? Correct! What we need is to add a \"dummy\" configuration cell which will allow us to test our code that has been added in the jupyter cells. Once we know each individual cell works we are much more confident our workflow will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've added a configuration that targets the radar at Den Helder and requests Radar Data from 2019-12-31 23:00 -> 2021-01-01 01:00. This should give us data around New years eve. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, `run` Cell 1 (# configuration-v30) and 2 (# DO NOT CONTAINERISE THIS CELL). Lastly, we need to add a reference database file which will help some of the functions determine the correct radar name to name the output files. Add `OPERA_RADARS_DB.json` to `/data/conf/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercise 2. Accessing KNMI Data Platform\n",
    "The next step is to create a code-block which can use this information we've specified and communicate with the data repository of the KNMI. We are going to create a code-block which can ask the API which files it has for our search query. We will search by specifying three parameters: `start_date`, `end_date`, `radar`. The API will then return us (if successful) a list of file names corresponding to Radar Measurements for our query. Copy the code below into a new cell in Jupyter.\n",

    "We have all the blocks in place to search, download, convert Polar Volume (PVOL) data into a format that we can start analyzing but also process further into more derivatives, such as a vertical profile. A Vertical Profile (VP) is a way for us to 'summarize' the large amount of data that the Polar Volume shows us. A Polar Volume of The KNMI can have up to 16 different parameters measured per elevation angle (step). Each Radar measures a number of elevation (steps). For that elevation, it measures a host of different quantities and returns those as datasets per quantity and elevation angle. For us to interpret all those elevation angles and quantities is extremely difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "To alleviate this difficulty, a Vertical Profile can be generated which analyses relevant quantities and elevation angles and attempts to determine the number of birds that have passed over an imaginary cross-section across the radar. It produces that information in a format which indicates per height bin a number of metrics. These metrics include the reflectivity in that specific bin, the expected number of birds / area and so on. The [github page of Vol2bird](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird) contains more information on vol2bird and includes links to publications explaining how vol2bird works. \n",
