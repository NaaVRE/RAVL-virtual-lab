    "# Radar Aeroecology Virtual Lab tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/Ravl_flowchart.png](images/Ravl_flowchart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the Radar Aeroecology Virtual Lab (RAVL), a tool developed by the [Animal Movement Ecology](https://ibed.uva.nl/content/research-departments/theoretical-and-computational-ecology/research/animal-movement-ecology/animal-movement-ecology.html) research group at the University of Amsterdam. RAVL simplifies the process of extracting animal movement data from weather radars. You will get to know its capabilities by exploring how the lab identifies mass migration events of small passerine birds. For a quick overview of the underlying concepts, watch [this 2 minute animation from the GloBAM project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjQQeXGvYc4). These exercises require no programming experience. From exercise 2 and onwards you will be asked to execute blocks of code within this notebook, so some experience working in Jupyter Notebooks is useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background information\n",
    "### Passerines \n",
    "Small passerine birds migrate en masse during Spring and Fall. Passerine birds do not migrate continuously throughout the migration season but instead seemingly wait for favorable weather conditions. These weather conditions have been identified to a certain extend and as such certain moments can be defined on which peak migration would likely occur. These migration events can be significant enough to observe on Meteorological Radars. \n",
    "### Meteorological Radar & Biological scatters\n",
    "Meteorological radars monitor the sky 24/7 by emitting a beam and detecting their reflections. These reflections are measured on a number of [elevation angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar#/media/File:Radar-hauteur-en.svg). While these radars are primarily designed for weather observation, most airborne objects, including birds, reflect a portion of the radar's beam. The phenomenom of radar beams being scattered by animals (e.g., birds, bats, and insects) is called biological scatter. This makes meteorological radars a valuable tool for observing large-scale bird migration events. However, as meteorological radar is not purposefully built to detect small passerines, some effort has to be made to produce meaningful data. Furthermore, a device measuring 24/7 produces much more data than research institues can handle, so some pruning is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Polar volume\n",
    "Polar volume data is the collection of data as measured by meteorological weather radars. The polar volume data represents 3D data; these dimensions are described in [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system). Therefore, polar volume data has attributes such as `range gates`, `elevation angle` and `azimuth angle` which can be used to map and project the data in various [coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system). The radar measures quite a number of parameters where `reflectivity` (DBZH) and `radial velocity` (VRADH) are the most common. In this tutorial we will be using the Herwijnen radar operated by the KNMI. KNMI has a website that also lists meta-data about the various radars. [Here](https://browser.dataplatform.knmi.nl/metadata/radar_volume_full_herwijnen~1.0~metadata.xml) you can have a look at the description of the variables measured by the Herwijnen radar. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial you will be introduced to some of the core principles of radar aeroecology, specifically meteorological radar data analysis. You will download meteorological radar data from the Netherands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), process that data, visualize and interpret the animal migration information obtained from that data. You will be introduced to more advanced visualization techniques in R by using the `bioRad` ([paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.04028), [library documentation](https://adriaandokter.com/bioRad/articles/bioRad.html)) package. As we have a decent understanding of favorable weather conditions we can narrow down our search towards the few times in the year that we have favorable conditions for passerines. Furthermore, we can apply certain transformations to the data which will allow us to filter, summarize and visualize the data which will help us focus on the actual migration rather than weather phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise notes\n",
    "Most exercises have a `Note:` section. This section generally explains a bit more about the how and what. This information is not necessary to do the tutorial but might be interesting to read. \n",
    "RAVL has a few core components that we will re-use in the NaaVRE's experiment manager ([documentation](https://naavre.net/docs/NaaVRE_Interface/#experiment-manager)) to get you started. Each exercise has a link to the relevant source code of that block. If you are interested, you are free to take a look. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meteorological radar data   \n",
    "The meteorological radar data used in this tutorial comes from the data repository of the Dutch meteorological institute (KNMI): [the KNMI Data Platform](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/). From this platform, we will be retrieving polar volume data which contains a host of parameters which can be used to detect biological echoes. The data can be requested from an API using an API key ([What is API?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api)). During workshops we will be using a workshop specific API-key. Due to the limited time in this workshop as well as and the limits set to the key; please try to keep your queries short. Practically this means: Choose a day to retrieve data for, not a year. If you decide you want to see an effect over a large temporal time span, the time interval between samples can be increased. For example: every 15th day of the month, every X'th hour of the day. You do not have enough time during this course to download, convert and analyze large amounts of data nor will the API-key allow all participants to download a large dataset. Rest assured, throughout the exercises you will be guided on how to query and stay within the fair-use guidelines and still get interesting results. If you are doing this tutorial outside a workshop, now is a good time to request a KNMI API key. You can request your own API key here: https://developer.dataplatform.knmi.nl/apis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MinIO Storage\n",
    "This virtual lab uses MinIO to permanenly store the data processed by the workflow. You can log into MinIO at https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001 using the same credentials as you're using to log into NaaVRE. In order to store and retrieve data from MinIO, you will need an access key. If you're doing this tutorial in a workshop, the access key needed to access this storage is provided. If you're doing this tutorial on your own, create an access key [in MinIO](https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001/access-keys). Make sure to store the access key and secret key.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1: Execute the weather radar data processing workflow\n",
    "In this exercise you will process weather radar data into biological scatter data by running a workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data processing workflow**  \n",
    "Open [Radar_data_processing.naavrewf](./../workflows/Radar_data_processing.naavrewf) (Can be found in the directory *RAVL-virtual-lab/virtual_lab/workflows*). This is a workflow that can download radar data and process it into biological scatter data. You should see a workflow consisting of 5 components similar to the image below. If you're interested, you can look at the source code of the components in [RAVL-virtual-lab/virtual_lab/codebase/RAVL.ipynb](./../codebase/RAVL.ipynb). Let's break down the components one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![images/Radar_data_processing.png](images/Radar_data_processing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 1 - Initializer:** The initializer checks if the workflow if configured correctly to process polar volume data. For instance, it makes sure it can find certain reference files in order to understand which Radars are being requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 2 - List KMNI files:** The second component communicates with the data repository of the KNMI. This component requests a KNMI API which data files exist for our search query. We will search by specifying three parameters: `start_date`, `end_date`, `radar`. If succesfull, the KNMI API will respond with a list of file names corresponding to radar measurements for our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note:` The measurement interval for Dutch meteorological radars is 5 minutes. This means that each radar can produce up to 288 measurements in a given day. Occasionally, radars fail to produce measurements and will therefore have less than 288 files. By default, this component yields files in an interval of 15 minutes as opposed to 5 minutes. This is deliberately done in an attempt to reduce the strain on the servers and services. For research purposes it may be usefull to set the interval to 5 minutes but during the tutorial a 15 minute interval should be kept. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 3 - Download KMNI (Polar Volume data):** The third component, *Download-KNMI*, downloads the data from the KNMI data repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 4 - KNMI to ODIM converter:** The files that we are downloading from the KNMI API are HDF5 files which contain polar volumetric data. The data we download is structured according to the [data model of KNMI](https://www.knmi.nl/kennis-en-datacentrum/publicatie/knmi-hdf5-data-format-specification-v3-5). Most of our analysis methods expect the format of the data model of [ODIM](https://www.eumetnet.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ODIM_H5_v23.pdf), which means we need to run a converter. This component will call a converter to convert the KNMI format to an ODIM format and returns us a list of files in ODIM format.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note:` This component executes a subprocess call to a custom C program written by [Hidde Leijense](https://www.knmi.nl/research/publications?author=+Hidde+Leijnse) of KNMI. Hidde Leijense is often involved in research with the Animal Movement Ecology of the University of Amsterdam as the KNMI and UvA collaborate frequently.\n",
    "We only convert the structure of data, not the file type. Both the KNMI and ODIM use the same filetype, [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/). HDF5 is an industry standard hierarchial data storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 5 - PVOL VP converter:** We have all the components in place to search, download, convert Polar Volume (PVOL) data into a format that we can start analyzing but also process further into more derivatives, such as a vertical profile. A vertical profile (VP) is a way for us to 'summarize' the large amount of data that the Polar Volume shows us. A polar volume of The KNMI can have up to 16 different parameters measured per elevation angle. Each radar measures a number of elevation angles. For that elevation, it measures a host of different quantities and returns those as datasets per quantity and elevation angle. For us to interpret all those elevation angles and quantities is extremely difficult. To alleviate this difficulty, a vertical profile can be generated using the vol2bird algorithm which analyses relevant quantities and elevation angles and attempts to determine the number of birds that have passed over an imaginary cross-section across the radar. It produces that information in a format which indicates per height bin a number of metrics. These metrics include the reflectivity in that specific bin, the expected number of birds / area and so on. The [github page of Vol2bird](https://github.com/adokter/vol2bird) contains more information on vol2bird and includes links to publications explaining how vol2bird works. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Note: Naming conventions` There is a lot of Python code in this component. Most of this code is applying naming conventions and versioning. The AME group of the University of Amsterdam has over 9.5 million vertical profiles stored across three (synchronized) storage systems. In order to provide overview and structure a strong naming convention has been enforced within the AME group to great success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow execution:**\n",
    "This workflow can retrieve and process any radar data from the Herwijnen (HRW) or Den Helder (DHL) meteorological radars. We are now going to run the workflow to retrieve and process data for a recent new year's evening. Find the `Run` button in the experiment manager and press it. An `execute workflow` pop-up should appear:\n",

    "Retrieving the data from KNMI and processing it will take between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. So it will be clear within a couple of minutes whether workflow execution has been successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow failure:** If the workflow did not execute successfully, two red crosses will be shown. In that case, click on the red cross of the component that has encountered an error (1) and click on `LOGS` (2):\n",

    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you have run a data processing pipeline to retrieve weather radar data and unravelled the biological scatter contained within it. However, you have not yet reaped the fruits of the work you offloaded to the processing workflow. In the following exercises you will learn how to visualise such data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2. Data visualization - Creating a timeseries from Vertical Profiles\n",
    "Exercise 1 has shown how to download weather radar data and run the vol2bird algorithm to retrieve biological scattteres from that data. As downloading and processing this data takes time, the amount of data you have processed in that exercise is limited. In this exercise we are going to use more data than we downloaded and processed in exercise 1, covering 3 days. The dataset is available in [MinIO](https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001/browser/naa-vre-public/dmwtdm9sMmJpcmQvcmF2bC10dXRvcmlhbC8=). This public dataset contains a known mass migration event.

    "1. Submitted multiple workflows causing Virtual Machines to start, communicate and stop automatically.\n",
    "2. Downloaded Weather Radar Data from the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI).\n",
    "3. Converted it to a industry standard format `ODIM`.\n",
    "4. Produced derivative data (Vertical Profiles) by using the vol2bird algorithm.\n",
    "5. Retrieved Polar Volume and Vertical Profile data from the cloud.\n",
    "6. Visualized Vertical Profiles in time-series.\n",
    "7. Created and visualized Plan Position Indicators made from reflectivity from Polar Volume scans.\n",
    "8. Built a new workflow for visualizing polar volume data for a time range.\n",
    "9. Parametrised a new workflow to produce Plan Position Indicators for a potential migration event through cloud computing.\n",
    "10. Created an animation from Plan Position Indicators, visualizing Radar images measuring actual biological movement.\n",

    "You've now completed the exercises for the tutorial for RAVL. However, there are a host of other things to do. Below, we've added some extra information and exercises to get you started on more open ended questions. There are two exercises set up where you will explore radar data to gain insight on peak migration and the effects of fireworks on local bird population. The peak migration exploration is done by using external databases to give an indication on when potential mass migration events could occur and then inspect those moments by visualizing VPTS and PPI. The fireworks exercise will guide you in exploring the effects of fireworks on birds in The Netherlands. The Netherlands has a liberal fireworks policy except during the pandemic which is an unique time-period to investigate. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Open questions\n",
    "## Identifying migration moments \n",
    "As the above list shows - you've accomplished a great deal. For this course text, we've provided some information on when we can expect certain migratory events. As an open exercise, feel free to use all the knowledge and information you've gained to find a _new_ migration event. This time - we do not have the convenience of having a line graph indicating moments of high migration. You also do not have the time during this tutorial to process a full year of data for a given radar. So, instead, try and use external sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now know that passerines:\n",
    "1. Wait for favourable wind conditions\n",
    "2. In Autumn, migrate predominately in a North -> South, SouthWest fashion\n",
    "3. In Spring migrate predominately in a South -> North, NorthEast fashion\n",
    "4. Will migrate after sunset and before sunrise\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use an external database for Wind to find favourable wind conditions in either migratory season for a year of your choice. Try and find a date that would have proper wind conditions. You can also check weather forecasts and reports to see if that particular day had a lot of rain or not. If it did - birds likely stayed aground. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've found a date, set all parameters for a day before and after. Then go through all exercises but now with your own start and end date. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Peak migration events based on Weather variables\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, it seems that birds tend to wait for favourable weather conditions before departing. Sometimes it takes too long to find these weather conditions and the birds depart in seemingly bad conditions. Therefore, we can't fully say when they depart but we can have a good estimate of when could be a good moment. By reviewing weather variables we can therefore estimate when birds could be departing en masse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Use weather variables to estimate when there would be a peak migration event. Once identified, generate PVOL and VP and visualize the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Information\n",
    "The website you can use to view a host of weather variables can be found here: [earth.nullschool.net](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2017/07/26/2200Z/wind/surface/level/orthographic=7.88,51.69,2762/loc=7.511,49.824). For Autumn migration, winds originating from the North and heading South, SouthWest seem to be favourable for passerine migration. In Spring (February - May) winds originating from the South and heading North NorthEast seem to be favourable. Furthermore, regardless of season rain is not favourable. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started, a few dates will be shown to you of where there is a peak migration event positive weather variables. Try some of the dates and see if you can see the favourable wind conditions. Also see what the wind direction was before the 8th of october and after the 13th of october, 2022. After that, use the earth.nullschool.net website to find more moments in time that could warrant peak migration. Pick one and visualize and verify.\n",
